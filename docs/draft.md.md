### Descriptors and Projections


"they cannot learn the discriminative features from 3D shapes."

[X] describes 


"Sinha et al. in [120] proposed
geometry images where 3D objects were projected into 2D grid so that the classical 2D CNNs can
be employed."

Think about data for computer graphics as 3D data is kind of unfair and doesn't convey the 

## Change of paradigm: AI Graphics

The convolutional network model 

We have a changed to a data driven paradigm in which our models are estimated from data.

shows 2 things
- change of paradigm
- application of classical ideias still holds

By sampling points over surfaces

output of scanning processes.
3D scanners ...

All of these are representations related to ours sensors (camera, LiDar etc) so it's easier to get the data.

In particular, multiview images are here "since forever" and we can avail all the progress that's been done in machine learning for computer vision and image processing
