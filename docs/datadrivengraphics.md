# Data Driven Graphics - THIS IS A SKETCH YET =)

Over the last decade, machine learning and specially deep learning promoted a revolution in multiple areas. In the Visual Computing domain, both image processing and computer vision benefited of this scenario and we saw machine learning models achieving the state of the art for *object detection and recognition* [X],  new techniques

The convolutional network model 


## Change of paradigm

We have a changed to a data driven paradigm in which our models are estimated from data.

shows 2 things
- change of paradigm
- application of classical ideias still holds

## AI Graphics

Now, we are capable of dealing with more complex data, non euclidean data and integrate in this cycle the computer graphics and geometry processing .

But to make data driven graphics, we need to represent 3D data and be able to either apply our known techiniques in these data or develop new techiniques to to deal with them. It turns out that research community's been doing both.

## 3D Data Representations

Think about data for computer graphics as 3D data is kind of unfair and doens't convey the
