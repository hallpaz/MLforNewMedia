# Data Driven Graphics 

Over the last decade, machine learning and specially deep learning promoted a revolution in multiple areas. For instance, in the Visual Computing domain, both image processing and computer vision benefited of this scenario as we saw machine learning models achieving the state of the art performance for tasks such as *object detection and recognition* and impressive results in generation tasks such as *image in-painting*, *image upsampling* and even whole videos of people moving and even talking - raising concerns about what we called *deepfakes*.

This results motivated researches to explore deep learning capabilities in more complex data representations such as graphs and 3D geometry. Working with more general data, outside of grid or sequential structures as images or audio allows us to derive data driven methods for computer graphics and geometry processing, building bridges to computer vision and image processing though machine learning techniques.

However, to make *data driven graphics*, we need to represent 3D data and be able to either apply our known techniques in these data or develop new methods to to deal with them. It turns out that research community's been doing both and some directions already presented promising results.


## 3D Data Representations

We start briefly describing some 3D data representations. Unlike images, which have a well stablished computational representation in terms of matrices of pixels, tridimensional objects and scenes have many different representation with different trade-offs. We don't intend to make an exhaustive analysis of these representations. For more details, please, refer to [1].

from those more related to the techniques and architectures employed in deep learning for computer vision.


### RGB-D Images

RGB-D data are a natural choice to represent 3D data as it comprises both appearance and geometry of a scene and it has a grid structure as regular images. This way, we can use everything already applied to images, including Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) and we must only figure out how to make the best use of the depth channel to solve problems in 3D.

SOME WORKS....[X, XX, XXX]

Besides that, depth images and RGB-D data are quite easy to capture nowadays. It's been over a decade since low cost devices as the Kinect are available in the market and today we can even find depth sensors in mobile devices such as the iPad. Due to this scenario, we have a good research literature on how to deal with noise in depth maps and even how to reconstruct surfaces from these kind of data. 

### Multiview images

Another way we can use images to represent 3D data is to work with a set of regular images from different viewpoints of the same object or scene. With a multi-view representation, we don't have any geometric data as we have in RGB-D, but with a sufficient amount of images we might be able to infer it. By working with multiples points of views we are also able to reduce noise, incompleteness, occlusion and illumination problems on data [XX Advances...]

### Voxels

Voxels are a natural extension to 3D of the ideia of a 2D pixel. It's a way to encode volumetric data in a regular grid in the three-dimensional space by describing which cells are occupied and which are not. We can extend this representation to encode, for instance, viewpoint information by classifying the occupied cells into visible, occluded or self-occluded. 

The simplicity of this representation comes at the cost of a high memory footprint as we have to store data for both occupied and unoccupied voxels. By using a hierarchical data structure such as an octree, we can have varying-sized voxels and use less memory to represent unoccupied space or low detailed . 

### Point Clouds

A point cloud is a set of data points in space with no specific order. Point clouds provide us information about a surface geometry, but lack information about its topology.  It's a common output of scanning processes and for that it has a low cost of acquisition. 

The unordered structure of a point cloud is a challenge for learning tasks as we must derive permutation invariant methods. PointNet [X] was the first architecture to make a direct use of point clouds as input and successfully encode this kind of data into robust features for classification and segmentation tasks. This made PointNet based encoders useful for many other problems of machine learning in computer graphics.

### Polygonal Mesh

A polygonal mesh is composed of a set of vertices and a connectivity list that describes how vertices are connected to form polygons - which are called faces. Polygonal meshes are the standard representation for many applications in computer graphics, specially visual media, as most Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have 

It's interesting to note that a polygonal mesh can be interpreted as a graph. Graphs are data structures 

Graph Neural Networks. This way, machine learning in polygonal meshes might benefit from methods being developed for learning in graphs of other domains.

### Implicit functions

We can also represent geometric models as an isosurface of a scalar field. This way we have a continuous representation of a surface given by an implicit function. Visualization of implicit surfaces can be computed with raytracing or we can subdivide the space and extract a polygonal mesh using a method like Marching Cubes. A continuous representation has some advantages as we have arbitrary resolution at a low storage cost. As neural networks are universal approximators for continuous functions [X], we can try to parameterize a target scalar field by a neural network. This approach has led to incredible results in the last months and is an highly active research field.

## It's only the beginning

We presented some common choices for representing 3D data for machine learning in computer graphics. There are current efforts and advances being made in each of these directions. Some representations are mode related to ours sensors, so they are easier to capture, on the other hand other representations are more suitable for 3D computer graphics tasks and applications for *new medias* such as real time rendering, artistic modeling or automated assets generation. 

Ideally we want to input the more abundant and easily available data representation such as ordinary 2D images and be able to infer the most scene/object properties as possible â€“ such as it's geometry, topology, appearance and so on. Doing that in a useful and standard representation for new media applications and in a more accessible way are also ideal requirements. To tackle such a big challenge, we proceed by reviewing what is already built and is currently being built in terms of tools, algorithms and ideas for this research endeavor.
