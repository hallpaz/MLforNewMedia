# Data Driven Graphics 

## DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SKETCH YET =)

Over the last decade, machine learning and specially deep learning promoted a revolution in multiple areas. In the Visual Computing domain, both image processing and computer vision benefited of this scenario and we saw machine learning models achieving the state of the art for *object detection and recognition* [X],  new techniques

The convolutional network model 


## Change of paradigm

We have a changed to a data driven paradigm in which our models are estimated from data.

shows 2 things
- change of paradigm
- application of classical ideias still holds

## AI Graphics

Now, we are capable of dealing with more complex data, non euclidean data and integrate in this cycle the computer graphics and geometry processing .

But to make data driven graphics, we need to represent 3D data and be able to either apply our known techiniques in these data or develop new techiniques to to deal with them. It turns out that research community's been doing both.

## 3D Data Representations

Think about data for computer graphics as 3D data is kind of unfair and doens't convey the 

### Multiview images



### RGB-D Images

kinect...

### Point Clouds

3D scanners ...

All of these are representations related to ours sensors (camera, LiDar etc) so it's easier to get the data.

In particular, multiview images are here "since forever" and we can avail all the progress that's been done in machine learning for computer vision and image processing

### Voxels

- natural extension of a pixel to 3D

### Polygonal Mesh

- standard for many applications in computer graphics, specially visual media.
- Graph Neural Networks

### Implicit functions

- continuous
- compact
- huge advances recently 

### These representations are not exaustive...

Ideally we want to input the more abundant and easily available data representation such as ordinary images and be able to infer/reconstruct the most a maior quantidade poss√≠vel of scene/object properties such as it's geometry, topology, appearance and so on, in a useful and standard representation for new media applications.
